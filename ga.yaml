# Google Analytics Realtime API Integration
#
# - Check must run at most every 60 seconds. Realtime metrics are reported by minute.
# - Use the service account email generated by Google console to give access to
#   profiles that will be reported to Datadog.
# - Be sure Datadog Agent can read key file.
#
init_config:
    service_account_email: example@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    key_file_location: /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/key.json
    
# - Create as many instances as google profiles will reported to Datadog
# - Each metric will be tagged with: profile + tags + dimensions
# - Other metrics will be added in the future (thus the tags variable here)
#
#
# Example
#
instances:
#   - profile: ga:12345678
#     min_collection_interval: 55
#     tags:
#      - env:production
#     pageview_dimensions:
#      - rt:country
#      - rt:city
#      - rt:deviceCategory
#
